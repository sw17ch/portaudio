Examples

    There are two patterns to IO with PortAudio: Callbacks and BlockingIO. Both are Supported by the
    Library and Relevant Examples are included. Certain more interesting examples require hsndfile
    (audio encoding/decoding based on sndfile).

    Although for the most part callbacks are the standard, they perform poorly if high quality streams
    are required and therefore, we primarily recommend the blockingIO approach. The Sample wave file
